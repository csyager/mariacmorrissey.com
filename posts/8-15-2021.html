					<br />
					<p>As a 22 year old with a new job and disposable income living in a new city, I fill a lot of my time checking social media often mindlessly scrolling, sometimes feeling inspired, and mostly comparing myself.  Recently, I came across this passage by Jia Tolentino in her novel, Trick Mirror, which resonated with me:</p>
					<p><i>“The internet has … redistributed our minimum of free time into unsatisfying micro-installments, spread throughout the day. In the absence of time to physically and politically engage with our community the way many of us want to, the internet provides a cheap substitute; it gives us brief moments of pleasure and connection, tied up in the opportunity to constantly listen and speak.”</i></p>
					<p>I decided that I wanted to be more deliberate with how I spend my time. I already tried spending $63 on a summer kickball team to make friends. 9 weeks later and a spot on a dodgeball team to fill the rest of my summer, I started searching for my next endeavor. I opted to fill one night a week after work spending a few hours on a hobby.</p>
					<p>I signed up for an “Introduction to Digital Photography” class that was scheduled to start in October. However, I was so eager to start learning something new that I found an open pottery class. A week before the class started, I sent an email to inquire about spots, and the following Monday I am sitting at a pottery throwing wheel for the first time in my life ready for 8 weeks of 3-hour long classes. I came out of that first class with my ego checked at the door. Man, was I clueless about how hard making pottery would be! </p>
					<p>I reminded myself that everyone else who I met in that studio, including the owner, had a first time at the throwing wheel. There is no point in comparing myself, a person who had no prior experience, to those around me who had done this for months or even years. A recent Instagram caption from a favorite professional runner of mine, Sara Hall, mentioned the idea of a “beginner’s mind.” She stated in her caption, “I love the concept of “beginner’s mind”, where even when you’ve been doing something a long time, you still approach it like a beginner- an attitude of openness, eagerness, and a lack of preconceptions or fearing failure.” Her post gave me an appreciation for being a beginner and seeing it as an asset and something to embrace rather than a hindrance. It excites me to imagine how much I could grow in 1 year or 5 years or even 20 years from now if I keep a beginner’s mind.</p>
					<p>After one 3-hour Monday night pottery class, I am even more eager to delve into my interests. Hmm, I see there’s a Darkroom Photography class that starts in September…</p>
					<p>Sign up for the class. Or three.</p>
