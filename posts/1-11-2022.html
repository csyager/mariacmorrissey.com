					<p>There's a quote I saw on a friend's Instagram a few years back that stuck with me ever since I read it. </p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p class="mb-0">"Some people talk to you in their free time, others free their time to talk to you."</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>It stuck with me not because I jumped towards using it to judge my friends, but because I jumped towards using it to judge my own friendship towards others. I thought, <i>wow - wouldn't I like to be the kind of friend that freed my time to talk to the people I care about.</i></p>

                    <p>It's a weird thing, becoming an adult. I used to marvel at my mom pacing around the house on the weekends or school nights talking for hours with a friend she'd had since childhood, doing a yearly catch up on birthdays or perhaps after one of them had emailed. I remember wondering, what would a 40- year friendship feel like, living on different coasts, and only talking once a year but for hours at a time? I admired it. As a 15-year-old, I wanted to believe that all my close friends at that age would become dear, life-long friends. </p>

                    <p>Since graduating college (during a pandemic), I no longer live in the same city as any of my closest friends. The pandemic made me realize that I take for granted that most of my friendships relied on seeing each other at least every couple of months, over college breaks or on the weekends at school. It's easy to come to an understanding with a close friend that we'll catch up when we see each other next. It's a lot harder to make the time to catch up with them during your busy life. Now that the pandemic has altered the frequency we get to travel and see our friends, it's more important than ever to not let your friendships subside to inertia. </p>

                    <p>Over Thanksgiving this year, I finally saw a close friend whom I haven't seen since December of 2019. Yes, we picked up right where we left off, but I realized that after finally reuniting our situations weren't changing. After the holidays, I was going back to living in Virginia and she was going back to living in a different state. I didn't want to go almost another 2 years without really having each other in our lives. So, I'm embracing the habits of my mom and I've determined that 2022 is the year I start calling my friends. So far, I've already spoken to 2 friends for almost an hour each. Conversations of true connection, without distraction - just time given and shared in friendship. We all have the time, it's just a matter of whether we are willing to free it for those we cherish.</p>
