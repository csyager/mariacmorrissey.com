					<h1 class="display-4">Slowing Down</h1>
					<h5 class="text-muted">October 11th, 2021</h5>
					<br />
					<p>I have a month to go before the New York City Marathon on November 7th and I have long ago let go of any expectation that I’d perform like my older brother who ran the NYC Marathon in 2018 with an average pace under 9 minutes with minimal preparation. My goal now is to finish the marathon and not get injured…with no expectation of time. I was a competitive long-distance runner in high school¬– I was captain of the cross-country team, I hold the school record in the 1000 meters, and I had a personal best 1500-meter time of 5:02 (note: there was no mile race for girls). In college, I went on a handful of runs each semester, usually running around an 8-minute pace but those runs were usually no more than 3 miles. When faced with training for the marathon, I had to deliberately slow down my pace in order to train at an aerobic (low) heart rate so I could run for longer distance. Slowing down in running has allowed me to run distances I have never been able to cover before. Now I can run 17 miles without much preparation because I run slow in all of my runs. Slow for me being an average pace of 11:20 per mile (I should add some tempo runs and speed work into my training, but as a self-coached runner I am doing the best I can). By letting go of my expectation to run fast, I have unlocked an ability to run far.</p>

                    <p>Slowing down in running has also given me the unexpected pleasure of slowing down in life. This past summer had been a whirlwind of events which included 10 weekends of out of town travel. With the turn of the season, I knew I needed to start up my fall marathon training so I left my calendar for the next few months largely unscheduled. Instead of filling my weekends with activities, I now made no plans except for my long run. This was an adjustment for me since my usual go-go-go personality thrives off of planning the next upcoming weekend by thinking of new possibilities of people to travel to or new places to try in town. But I found that slowing down has given me more time to get into hobbies that I didn’t prioritize when I had a packed social schedule.  During these “slow” weekends, I’ve had more time for baking and reading and going to the farmer’s markets and spending hours at coffee shops. I have been able to feel more consistently present. Just as the saying goes to “run the mile you’re in,” I have felt the ease to live the hour I’m in.</p>

                    <p>I know that soon my schedule will get filled again with friends and travel, but in this present period of my life, I am enjoying the pace. When the NYC Marathon starts, I know I’ll feel that adrenaline rush and urge to run fast and pass the slower runners in the race. Yet I hope my “slow” training will enable me to not just look towards the finish line. I want to look around me to enjoy the diverse crowds in each community, and to slowly take in the sights and sounds of each of the 26.2 miles.</p>
